## Library
### Description
Keep a log of your favorite books in one place and mark them as read to keep track of your past reads. 
### Instructions
Add basic information about a book to create an individual card for each book. Each card may be deleted at any time, or simply marked as read. Cards may be sorted by add date, title, author, or publication year, and a log count is displayed at the top of the page to conveniently keep track of read vs unread books. Local storage is enabled to allow cards to remain stored as long as the same browser on the same specific device is being used.
